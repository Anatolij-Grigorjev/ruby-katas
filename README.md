## Ruby Katas

Katas can be a great way to improve our understanding of syntax. 
For these problems please try to solve them by passing one test at a time.

## Getting started

`gem install minitest`
`cd word-count`
`ruby word_count_test.rb`

## Problems
Please work through the problems in any order you wish :)
